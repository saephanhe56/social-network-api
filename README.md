## Description

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

This social network api helps the user view, create, update, amd delete data from a database using Insomnia and MongoDB. The user can make changes to the users, user's thoughts, reactions, and friend's list. 

## Installation

Clone the repo via GitHub. Install the required programs - Insomnia, MongoDB, Express.JS, Mongoose, and Moment.JS


## Usage

Go to the correct folder in the terminal. Enter npm i to install the necessary packages. Next, enter npm i express, then npm i mongoose, then npm i moment. After that enter npm start to initialize the server. If it's successful, a message will indicate that "API server running on port 3001!". Now you can open Insomnia to test the routes and make changes to the user and database. Also make sure MongoDB is opened and start the connection.
